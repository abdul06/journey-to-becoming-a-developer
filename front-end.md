# THIS IS NOT EASY!! BUT YOU CAN DO IT!!
- STAY CONSISTENT AND DISCIPLINE 

# Recommendation For a front engineer… 
I would learn HTML, CSS, Javascript..
  - HTML - this is like the structure of the house (studs, electircal, plumbing)
  - CSS - (this is all the finishing touches of the house, paint, decor, flowers)
  - Javascript - (this is the action that take place, water flowing when you open the fascut, lights turning on using the switch, etc)


## What to learn after next
- Learn data structures and algorithms using Javascript
  - Important for both a front-end and a back-end developer
- Reactjs - after learning the web building block, learn a front end framework and I recommend Reactjs
  - What react does is allow for a structures approach to working with a website, 
  - if you see alot of fancy types of actions happening in the website react give you the ability to do this in a more structures approach
  - It give you the ability to make more reuseable code in a structures format while writing less code if you have a lot of interacitons on the webpage
- Sass - extention to css (css with behavior and superpowers)

- Next you can venture
  - build tools - gulp, webpack
  - comand line - linux
  - containerization - Docker


## Projects - Ideas
- Build a protfolio website (copy one you see)
  - https://vsantos.info/

- Javascipt - Client side programming language (add fancy interactive behaviors to your website)

## Tools
- IDE: (either ide is fine, make sure you know how to step debug in your code
  - Vscode - https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
  - Git - version control system (https://git-scm.com/)
  - Github - hosting for version control (code in the cloud) (https://github.com/)
  - Docker - run application in container (understand later, not important vs the other items you will learn…) (https://www.docker.com/)
