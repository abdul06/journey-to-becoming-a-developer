# THIS IS NOT EASY!! BUT YOU CAN DO IT!!
- STAY CONSISTENT AND DISCIPLINE 

# Recommendation For a backend engineer… 
- I would learn Python and go deep into understanding the language… 
- I would have a good understanding of data structures and when to use different one. 
- If you are trying to go into big tech you will need to dive really deep into data structure and algorithms…(coding interviews). 
- The thing is with backend engineering is you do not have the client (website to see your cool changes in that fashion) but I believe it is still super fun to do…

## What to learn after your language (Python)
- After Python I would learn Postgres SQL (Database technology). Super important for storing data and building restful api (video below describing this concept).

## Learn how to use the command line (linux based) will make your life a lot easier…

## Projects - Ideas
- Now after you python and postgresql my recommended first project would be to build a CRUD rest api  (create, read, update, delete),  than add authentication, also add  free email api to send emails (send grid)… etc add whatever else you would like at this point.

- Build a system that reads a csv and outputs it to a google sheet

- Build a system that takes a photo and resizes it and gives it a new background color
- 
- Just keep building stuff… (lots of ides and materials out there)

## Technology List
- Python - Programming Language
- PostgresSQL - Database
- Linux based command line
## Tools
- IDE: (either ide is fine, make sure you know how to step debug in your code
  - Vscode - https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - Pycharm - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
  - Git - version control system (https://git-scm.com/)
  - Github - hosting for version control (code in the cloud) (https://github.com/)
  - Docker - run application in container (understand later, not important vs the other items you will learn…) (https://www.docker.com/)


## Programing Concepts That are really good to know… (Intro)
- Syntax
- Data Types
- Control Structures
- Data Structures
- I/O (input and output)
- Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
